      <div className="faq-section">
        <h2>Part 1: Introduction and General Information</h2>

        <h3>1. What is the Digimine App?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>
          The Digimine App is an innovative digital platform that enables users to mine, manage, and trade Digikoinsâ€”digital tokens backed by physical gold measured in kilograms. By integrating blockchain technology with tangible assets, Digimine offers a secure, transparent, and efficient way to engage in digital asset mining and investment.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gold-Backed Digital Tokens: Each Digikoin represents ownership of a specific amount of physical gold, providing intrinsic value and stability.</li>
          <li>User-Friendly Mining Interface: The app offers an intuitive interface for users to participate in mining activities, even without prior technical expertise.</li>
          <li>Secure Transactions: Utilizing blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are transparent, immutable, and secure.</li>
          <li>Real-Time Monitoring: Users can track their mining progress, token holdings, and market trends in real-time within the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How does the gold backing of Digikoins work?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Each Digikoin is directly linked to a specific amount of physical gold stored in secure, audited vaults. This linkage ensures that the value of Digikoins is intrinsically tied to the value of gold, providing stability and trust for users.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Mechanism:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gold Reserves: Digimine maintains physical gold reserves equivalent to the total number of Digikoins in circulation. These reserves are stored in high-security vaults and are subject to regular third-party audits to verify their existence and quantity.</li>
          <li>Token Issuance: New Digikoins are minted only when additional physical gold is acquired and added to the reserves, maintaining a 1:1 ratio between Digikoins and gold holdings.</li>
          <li>Transparency: Users have access to audit reports and real-time data on gold reserves through the app, ensuring full transparency and confidence in the gold backing of their digital assets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Is Digikoin a cryptocurrency or a digital asset?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>Digikoin is a hybrid digital asset that combines characteristics of traditional cryptocurrencies and asset-backed tokens.</p>
        <p><strong>Classification:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cryptocurrency Features: Like traditional cryptocurrencies, Digikoins can be mined, traded, and used for transactions within the Digimine ecosystem. They operate on a decentralized blockchain network, ensuring security and transparency.</li>
          <li>Asset-Backed Features: Unlike typical cryptocurrencies, each Digikoin is backed by a specific amount of physical gold. This backing provides intrinsic value and reduces volatility, making Digikoins a stable digital asset.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Regulatory Considerations:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Depending on jurisdictional regulations, Digikoins may be classified differently. Users are encouraged to consult local regulations and seek professional advice to understand the legal status of Digikoins in their respective regions.
        </p>

        <h3>4. How can I start mining Digikoins using the Digimine App?</h3>
